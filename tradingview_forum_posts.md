## 2. Reddit r/TradingView Post

**Title:** After months of debugging Pine Script errors, I'm building an AI solution - PineCraft AI

**Post:**
Fellow TradingView users,

I've been coding Pine Script for years, and if there's one thing that drives me crazy, it's spending hours debugging syntax errors instead of focusing on strategy development.

That's why I'm building **PineCraft AI** - an AI-powered tool that:

✅ Fixes Pine Script syntax errors instantly
✅ Converts plain English descriptions into working Pine Script v6 code
✅ Helps you build strategies focused on positive expectancy
✅ Provides real-time coding assistance

**Why am I building this?**
Last month, I spent 3 hours debugging a simple bracket error. THREE HOURS! That's when I realized - we need a better solution. ChatGPT is great, but it's not specialized for Pine Script and often gives outdated v4 code.

**What makes PineCraft different:**
- Trained specifically on Pine Script v6
- Understands TradingView's unique requirements
- Focuses on creating profitable strategies, not just functional code
- One-click error fixes with explanations

**Pricing:** $47/month at launch (with a 30% discount for early adopters)

I'm looking for beta testers! If you're interested, comment below with your biggest Pine Script frustration.

What features would make your Pine Script coding life easier?
